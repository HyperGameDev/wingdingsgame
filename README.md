<p class="text-center">The challenge was to code a game while the scripts and IDE fonts were all changed to Wingdings.</p>
<p class="text-center">The game itself also had to use Wingdings as its font for both assets and UI.</p>
<p class="text-center">I was not even allowed to copy and paste the Wingdings code outside of the script editor to peek at what it actually said!</p>

<p class="text-center">Finally, for every hour that I didn't finish the game, the chat could vote on a new theme (or no theme) that I had to incorporate... I got them all in!</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Extra themes: Wing "dings", Dice, Ghost, Ice, Add a shader, Ground is Wingdings, and Random colors every game start.</strong></p>

<h3 class="text-center">I was so happy to see English text after this challenge...</h3>
<p class="text-center">I'm so proud to have finished this! But of course, I had some help from the Hyper Game Dev community too.</p>
